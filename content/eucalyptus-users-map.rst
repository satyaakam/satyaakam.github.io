| it all started with me lazily skimming through pages on the
  `eucalyptus <http://www.eucalyptus.com>`__ site yesterday, soon i
  landed on `GSOC
  page <https://projects.eucalyptus.com/redmine/projects/gsoc2012>`__
  since this is something whose results have been announced just
  yesterday too , from here i moved on to there next page `Eucalyptus
  ideas
  page <https://projects.eucalyptus.com/redmine/projects/gsoc2012/wiki/Ideas>`__ ,
  read on there website that they are have been not given the GSOC slots
  ,there idea number two is implemented here `Eucalyptus users
  map <http://satyaakam.net/Eucamap/>`__ , do send me feedback as to how
  it looks and works , in the meantime if you are interested in the
  first cut i tried making yesterday using the Wp plugin below is that
  version too
