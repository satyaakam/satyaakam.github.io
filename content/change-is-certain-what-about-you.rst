After attending the #WCI met and heard many pro bloggers and developers
from the field of blogging , the guy who really was impressive was OM of
`gigaom <http://giagaom.com>`__ fame. He was too good after listening to
him and learning from his kind words i have decided to change the line
on my Blog from [STRIKEOUT:Change is certain what is your Foss
Startegy!!] to Change is Certain what about You!! sounds easy and makes
it more personal .

Yes my take on the event #WCI is , it met my expectations and i was more
than happy to meet new faces and understand there issuesÂ  with respect
to development,legal and start up point of view. Hope to be more active
and try to contribute to it in future!!

Right now got to get back to setting my Page and playing with plethora
of plugins WP has to offer, i am a newbie to the blogging world do write
about the mistakes i am doing while writing or otherwise ....
