| Over the last two decades i had the privilege  to learn and teach many
  people from the Foss community . one of the mantras i learned from
  `Adempiere <http://www.adempiere.com/>`__\ community especially from
  ` Redhuan D. Oon <http://red1.org/>`__ is where he defines and
  consolidates what a community means to him in three lines.

i for one has been lucky in this life to meet and work with  more of the
third kinds , today when we see the generation X ,  we see a Gap in the
understanding of the spirit and the doubt towards what this is all about
. i have decided to compile a book with these stories in order to
encourage young students of genx as an inspiration to become  the third
kinds. i am looking for people either themselves or  there stories of
pains and pleasures to be documented for the next generations to come.
do suggest me or get in touch with me if you want anyone from the
community to be covered in this book.
