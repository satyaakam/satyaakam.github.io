Ok i decided to change title of my blog from "Free and  Open Source " to
 "whats on your mind" yes the first one was good focussed one  on  one
topic but i felt and  that what i do is more than just FOSS.  This gives
me the freedom to write here instead of places like Facebook  or Twitter
or Identi.ca . Ok whats on the plate to start with the new title "whats
on your mind " yes you got it right its been flicked from Facebook ,
thanks to there policy changes they were  in News for past few  weeks  ,
actually i really like it  so does so many of millions of  Facebook Fans
.

i started digging and try to find out the social maps which exists and
the  connections i can see , obviously FB was the tool of choice to
begin with i hit upon my first search with
`Nexus <http://apps.facebook.com/_nexus_/>`__ which has shut down ;-( ,
but it gave me enough apps using which i can do pretty much what i
wanted here are the list of applications on Facebook which mapped social
connections not only they did that they were digging more into the
connections.

| `Touch
  Graph <http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=3267890192>`__
|  `NamegenWeb <http://bit.ly/cgFXNa>`__
|  `Friedn Wheel <http://bit.ly/aVJ4OL>`__

i am sure there are more ways to dig in with the `Graph
API <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api>`__.

For all those people who are afraid after seeing the web of connections
and having privacy concern there is no straighforward way to deactivate
your Facebook account , deactivating actually does not help you in
deleting all the data , to actually wipe all the info you need to go to
this link `Delete Facebook account <https://ssl.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account>`__
for all the other folks who do not want to delete the account here is a
scanner to test your `reclaimprivacy <http://www.reclaimprivacy.org/facebook>`__ privacy
setting on Facebook.
