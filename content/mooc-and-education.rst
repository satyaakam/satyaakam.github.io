Education and learning are terms used synonymously , i agree with
`Seymour Papert <http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~emurphy/stemnet/papert.html>`__
and the people who have been influenced over decades by his writings.

last few years i have been  seeing a lots of buzz around the word
`MOOC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course>`__ ,
just few years before the  term like
 `Elearning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning>`__ had a similar
effect on us  . Initially all the entrepreneurial kinds tried to
capitalize this rush using technologies in last two decade like Flash
etc and everyone's focus was on the content and selling this content in
the digital formats in India too there has been efforts , they were
basically digitizing all the textbooks and were calling it Elearning.

then came the craze of devices like
`OLPC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child>`__ in 2006 , i
learned about it around 2007 , The idea was started will all good
intentions but it had its own flaws in the model and approach  , you can
learn about the current status of the
`project <http://one.laptop.org/>`__ here . The two contributions i see
from this projects are Netbooks , Tablets frenzy and `Sugar
Environment <http://www.sugarlabs.org/>`__ , which again are ideas which
are way ahead of time , when people are still stuck on there Elearning
mentality . all of a sudden the combo of hardware and software for a
digitized classroom became so important as though the world is going to
end tomorrow. Elearning companies popped up some of them made it through
this gold rush too.

at this point i would like to differentiate between Education and
Learning , The so called form has changed from television to computers
and  now to internet . all that has been happening is so far in
 education is sort of push in the education terms .

Enter MOOC's \ `Khan Academy <http://www.khanacademy.org/>`__ ,
`Coursera <https://www.coursera.org/>`__ ,
`Udacity <http://www.udacity.com/>`__ , `Edx <https://www.edx.org/>`__
,\ `p2p <http://www.p2pu.org>`__ ,
`Udemy <%20http://www.udemy.com%20>`__ are some good examples of these
here  again a wild rush to capitalize and transform the education sector
into an open play ground . Traditional universities have all joined in
 the race too .i feel because of over growing pressure to increase the
base and  reduce the capital expenditure they feel , this is it the holy
grail to fix education  .

There are two of MOOC's  happening here one is a unstructured and the
other is structured around to fit the traditional education  , the
content is good , exams and tests are all conducted on a scheduled way
in the structured form of delivery .

i did hacking around last year to make a clone of called
`Fossacademy <http://satyaakam.net/2011/10/24/fork-from-fossacademy/>`__,
now i
see  \ `course-builder <https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/>`__ is
based out of it too , i have looked \ `p2p <p2pu.org>`__ code base  ,
the good thing them is they have a way to give students exercies and
measure there learning while they are enrolled to the courses , but the
approach i like the most so far has been the `Social
 contructivism  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism>`__ 
and a good example of it find the `Free and Open source
culture <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>`__ way 
and project like `nand2tetris <http://www.nand2tetris.org/%20>`__ .

So what is happening to Education well its happening and places of
learning have started to pop up too in the name of New Age schools ,
since we need to re look at the way our next generations are going to
learn from things around them .
