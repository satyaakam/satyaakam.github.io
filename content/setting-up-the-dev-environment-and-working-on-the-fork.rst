Khanacademy.org code is lying here
`Source <http://code.google.com/p/khanacademy/wiki/Source?tm=4>`__ , the
link from here will point us to the `Source
Link <https://khanacademy.kilnhg.com/Repo/Website/Group/stable>`__ i
have checked and tried getting kinhg account looks like it a paid site
and we need to pay after 45 days , my initial though before visiting
this site was to branch and maintain a tree there itself looks like it
is not as open as it claims. So the other option is to fork since the
code is anyway licensed under
`BSD2 <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php>`__ lincense .

We are going to maintain two Repos one of Khanacademy ( KA) and one of
Fossacademy (FA) .

why maintain KA code , because initially when we start off as FA we will
have just KA code but over time it is going to differ and change in ways
, but also we will have some changes upstream in KA which we will be
needing from time to time to fix bugs which must have already crept in.

yes it is a overhead we have to live with for the time being .

coming back to the FA we will be maintaining the code on
`Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`__ , and everyone will pull from the
stable FA and start maintaining the FA trunkc or fork they will be free
to take the call .

on maintaining the dev environment , i found any variant of
`Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>`__ to be a
good\ `IDE <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>`__
to maintain the code , you are free to maintain any IDE/Editor you are
comfortable with .

this video explains it all `Setting Dev
environment <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhBeXhZJMUw>`__\ using
eclipse .

i will be writing on the goals and specs for the project as we move
along keep watching this space ...
