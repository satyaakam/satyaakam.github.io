`Planning Commision <http://planningcommission.nic.in/>`__ in
Collaboration with `NIC  <http://www.nic.in/>`__ especially the
`Data.gov.in  <https://www.data.gov.in/>`__ Team ( which is  setup
according to the
`NDSAP <http://data.gov.in/sites/default/files/NDSAP_Implementation_Guidelines-2.0.pdf>`__ guildelines)  organized
a Hackathon to hack the `12th five year
plan  <http://12thplan.gov.in/>`__ for those of who are not aware like
most of us `Five years plans in
India <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-Year_plans_of_India>`__ are
economic blueprints  from Planning Commission as to how are are going to
spend in Next Five years.

We were at the venue around 11am , when things were still settling down
at the Venue `IIT Delhi  <http://www.iitd.ac.in/>`__ , we were supposed
to be connected to the live webconference in the opening ceremony but
due to connectivity issues we were able to just watch the broadcast ,
but being in Delhi it was ok since there were frequent visit by
 organizers just to check on how things were progressing.

In the whole commotion we sat in a corner and started talking about what
to build we were froze on the `Build your Plan
 idea <https://github.com/geohacker/12th-plan/blob/master/geohackers_presentation.pdf>`__
at around 2 Pm and started working on it there were two classrooms 6LT1
and 6LT2 allocated for us to sit and complete the work in the meantime
there were announcements and updates presentation from different sectors
as to what there
`expectations <http://planningcommission.nic.in/hackathon/index.php>`__\ were
as to this Hackathon , it was almost 5 Pm by the time others settled
down and started the work in the meantime we were done with front end of
our application. `Sajjad <https://twitter.com/geohacker>`__\ and
`Ramnique <https://twitter.com/RamniqueSingh>`__\ coded the front end in
two session one sitting in `Cafe Qahwa  <http://www.cafeqahwa.in/>`__.
We realized we were not productive enough so we moved back home.

Day two we were all supposed to submit the applications by 12 in the
noon and the presentations would be starting from 2 PM ,  we pushed the
submit button just in nick of time with Sajjad Ramnique and `Sumandro
  <https://twitter.com/ajantriks>`__ with a hardly any blink whole night
.

First on the block were us Sumandro presented our idea and the Jury was
interactive and liked out idea . Here is the link to `Build Your
App <http://geohacker.github.io/12th-plan>`__\ the live application
.  we hung around the venue till late in the evening till all the
presentations were over .

|Once the user plays with his allocations he will get different
scenarios showing how his plan will look.This he can share with people
which they can vote on.|

overall the experience has been a positive one with some scope for
improvements like the internet connectivity was bad we were using our
own 3G phones as access points . Students were not equipped and educated
to what was expected from the event. Lots of disturbance with the so
called VIP's visiting the venue now and then. No proper place to sleep
yes people who hung out at the Venue were defending mosquitoes rather
than building something .

Being first one for the Govt it must have been and educational
experience , they also need to involve and publicize the event more in
the public like they do to there Schemes in the Newspapers.

here are some of the moments in `pictures <http://t.co/iC5o7pfhnW>`__
and all the `winners <https://www.data.gov.in/hackathon/winners>`__
listed here , i wished they have put the list of all the people no
matter how small the effort was because in an event like this everyone
benefits and everyone is a winner.
