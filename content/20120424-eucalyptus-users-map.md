# Eucalyptus users Map

it all started with me lazily skimming through pages on the [eucalyptus](http://www.eucalyptus.com) site yesterday, soon i landed on [GSOC page ](https://projects.eucalyptus.com/redmine/projects/gsoc2012) since this is something whose results have been announced just yesterday too , from here i moved on to there next page [Eucalyptus ideas page ](https://projects.eucalyptus.com/redmine/projects/gsoc2012/wiki/Ideas) , read on there website that they are have been not given the GSOC slots ,there idea number two is implemented here [Eucalyptus users map ](/Eucamap/) , do send me feedback as to how it looks and works , in the meantime if you are interested in the first cut i tried making yesterday using the Wp plugin below is that version too   [mapsmarker marker="2"]
