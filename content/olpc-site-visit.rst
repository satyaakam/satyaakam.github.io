, overall the visit has been fruitful saw sugar @ work kids discovering
and learning new things on there own , there were some 10 Xo's which
attracted around 200 kids from in and around the village.

The weather was too hot and dry i did not feel the humidity like Chennai
so suggested them to install water cooler . The most popular activities
were Paint , Wikipedia , lack to Internet is something which needs to be
looked into to get these kids talk out to the world.

on 20th the next day i visited one more school which is a govt school
which is underÂ \ `Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan <http://www.ssa.tn.nic.in/>`__
programme of govt of India , here i learned about the ABL ( activity
based learning ) which is similar to activity based in Sugar but it was
more structured in the sense of the kid goes from one class to other
after he has completed a set of activities in on subject or class. In
this school the four XO's are provided the programme is schedule to
begin after summer holidays.

things to be done in coming days , XO's need Sugar upgrade. Teachers
need training , identify kids who can teach other kids , get Internet
connection so that they can connect to the larger OLPC community .
