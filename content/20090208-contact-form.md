**[Rupesh Nehra](#2 "2012-05-30 21:56:22"):** Hello sir, I am working on a project on DTC buses real time information. Gaurav Luthra, pursuing project at IIT Delhi told me about you. He said that you are mentoring a team doing work on "bus" project. Since i am too doing work on the same project, it will be good that people with same interest meet & discuss about it. May be i have a new idea on which you like to hear on. It is my humble request to you that please provide the contact details of the peoples who are working on that project. Either drop me their e-mail or phone no. so that i could connect with them & work with them on the project. Yours sincerely Rupesh Nehra Student- BBE South Campus, Delhi University.
