Got the above logo done by posting for a volunteer job on
`jobs.hasgeek.com <http://jobs.hasgeek.com/>`__ , with in a  day of
posting i got a very good response the best presentation and entry
was from `spurline <http://spurline.in>`__ , it had a concept too it
said  " For me, FOSS events have always being about getting introduced
to new area of learning. Its about ‘seeing the light’… " , thanks
`Hasgeek <http://hasgeek.com>`__ and `Spurline <http://spurline.in>`__
for making this happen.
