This is one question has been asked on the web and the young people i
meet day in and day out. They are all educated and literati of this
world , still they have this Question How? and sometimes Why?

i think it all starts with giving or so called sense of sharing without
any expectations , i think that's the key to it all . This all starts
with sharing your thoughts , ideas and writings you actually are on the
path to contributing , because in Foss Communities collaborations is
they key to the sucessÂ  of an idea. lets examine these in more detail
hopefully people who ask these questions will get there answers
somewhere or never since it takes time and energy to let go your Old
Habits and relearn the new ones, the best document i have come so far in
this direction is from
