| Hi,
|  After looking at Khanacademy.org and following it  for few months now
  with both on development and content front i am convinced that if
  education , especially Foss education has to be done it can be done
  this way.

i have been trolling  on sites  sites like
`ShowMeDo <http://showmedo.com/>`__ and
`Youtube <http://www.youtube.com/>`__ for quite a long now , and they
have come up in a very good way content wise. The two things which Khan
has done which is a good thing is

| 1) Monitoring students learning experience in the forms of coach
|  2) Assessing the students in the forms of tests
|  3) Knowledge maps  yes some of it i have seen some time back on
  `Gnowledge <http://www.gnowledge.org/>`__ but it did serve the pupose
  of self paced learning and assessment.

to know about more features you can check out
`Khanacademy.org <http://www.khanacademy.org/about>`__

Yes of course we cannot compare to the `Sal
Khan's <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan_%28educator%29>`__
passion and delivery mode which i think is unique of  every teacher in
this world.

So why this post , yes i have started thinking on the lines of taking
khanacademy.org code and making fossacademy.org with Foss content.

the content is going to come from the following sources

.. raw:: html

   <li>

`ShowMeDo <http://showmedo.com/>`__

   </li>
   <li>

`Youtube <http://www.youtube.com/>`__

.. raw:: html

   </li>
   <li>

`Phpacademy <http://www.phpacademy.org/>`__

.. raw:: html

   </li>

would like to add to the list more content sites as and when i start
getting suggestions.

for the folks who are interested in contributing and asking more
questions i will be available on irc.freenode.net #fossacademy .
