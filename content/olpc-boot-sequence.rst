Tried booting `OLPC <http://laptop.org>`__ from USB , OLPC has a
security feature to not boot from external devices by default , it comes
with a security lock , we can remove this by

| a) Getting a Developer key
|  b) Flashing the firmware

The idea is to boot from USB device and run Ubuntu from USB then some
apps over it, hope AMD processor with 256 MB of Ram can take all this.
