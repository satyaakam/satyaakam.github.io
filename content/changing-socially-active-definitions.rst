You twit N times a day , when you meet people you ask Are you on
FaceBook , Linked in , or any of the social networking sites , do you
make friends then meet or friend is just a number game for you , are
these social networking sites really helping the Family and society as a
unit together or its just an extension to say hi to everyone and giving
updates on status of your social well being ? is FB just an extension to
good old community living or just a way to survive in a  world where
connecting and meeting folks on FB is just an easy way that  you have
accepted and want to continue. What is your  the definition of being
socially active ?

What happened to the good old Sarai's and community programs do they
still exist or taken a new avatar and use FaceBook as only a platform ,
what happened to our good old Linux Users Groups
http://www.linux-india.org/ LUG's are they thriving because of a New
tool in the form of social networking sites or they just don't exist
anymore , or they have lost somewhere in middle in all the noise try to
to find a meaning of Community .

I think the FOSS as a technology has matured enough and has been
embraced  by industry, and the level of bifurcation or so called
specialization has reached  a stage  where in we need specific users
groups like firefox , open office , Coders,Admins , Activist so on and
so forth , i see http://www.gtugs.org/ too  poping up and discussusions
floating around on  LUG mailing lists  about have jquery or
Drupal/Wordpress sessions actually Jermy allision and chris di bona
talks about this phenomenon in this
`video <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBIFY6OGMBg>`__  too. I see this
phenomenon happening in India also  .

So the meaning of being social or community is getting into  smaller
groups with focus on few things and more towards mechanization of
something like assembly like with folks doing smaller tasks in big
numbers and other things like Internet , distributions , email , irc ,
FaceBook will be taken granted for that they will not be meeting too
often physically untill and unless some project demands.
