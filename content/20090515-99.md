**[Sam Khawse](#7 "2009-06-11 00:02:45"):** Congrats Satya! I am a ERP developer and die hard Open Source fan. Wanted to contribute to OpenSource ERP. I was confused over Compiere, OpenBravo and Adempiere... I guess Adempiere is the best of all and would like to contribute. I am really delighted that a fellow Indian is already is in the upper echelons of Adempiere. Following your lead I am sure I'll be able to provide my humble contribution. Kudos! Sam K.
