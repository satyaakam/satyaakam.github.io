to work  the `project in pursuit of an
'idea' <http://data.gov.in/community/idea-collaboration>`__  was
conceived packed and delivered with a short time frame of May-August .
Overall the takes from the projects are the team is amazing to work with
, with in few days i was using the line "i work for a start up called
data.gov.in"  the iterations were real quick and the energy levels were
high. i managed to make tons of connect and good friends at the end of
it all . All the projects in the final are `posted
here  <http://iic.ac.in/projects/>`__. Working on a final film on what
has transpired in the programme.

`Cryptoparties <https://www.cryptoparty.in>`__ While we were doing the
project with Delhi university there we also organized few crypto parties
notably `this one  <https://www.cryptoparty.in/delhi-2013-07>`__\ which
was a nightout affair in `IIC <http://iic.ac.in>`__\ Delhi university
