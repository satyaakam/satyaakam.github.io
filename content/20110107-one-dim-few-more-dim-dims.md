# One Dim few more Dim Dim's

i got a mail from Dimdim this morning "Dimdim has been acquired by salesforce.com. Your free Dimdim account will remain active until March 15, 2011. After that date, you will no longer be able to access your free Dimdim account." not that i have been a great fan of this product apart from the initial interest and hoopla i had , also one of the official test drives i took as a consultant for a client of mine, now my predictions and [others ](http://bit.ly/9dBu6p) are coming true , to start off have you checked out the sources tried building it , have you seen the hue and cry on the forums , have you heard of the hidden agenda in the name of Foss all that is Dimdim was . yes it may have released some source on SF but it did not have steam on its own to make it so they took the easy route out....of redemption all else will be history. Lessons for all other FOSS and not so Fossy companies , and young enterpreneuers alike know your priorities if you want to come out with a great FOSS product and want to exit at some point in time do so gracefully , because at the end of the day you will be coming back to FOSS community for new ideas and getting things done , i see a lot of noise to become the Number one Foss company in the form of support or product development has become the new buzz word in the last three years of recession , many of these companies are going to go Dim Dim Dim way so watch out this space for more.
