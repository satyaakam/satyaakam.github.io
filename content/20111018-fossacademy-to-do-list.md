# Fossacademy to do list

For those of who do not know [Fossacademy](http://fossacademy.org) is a going to be a remix site of [Khanacademy](http://khanacademy.org) , well after a long hiatus i was able to understand how app works in [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/), here is a list of things to do let me know if anyone wants to work on this project. 1)Create a logo. 2)Work on the theme. 3)Adding Videos other than Youtube. 4)Start working on making exercises. Hope people will like the effort as usual send in your comments and critiques .
