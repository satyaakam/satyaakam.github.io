  <div>
    <p>Khanacademy.org code is lying here
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/khanacademy/wiki/Source?tm=4">Source</a> , the
link from here will point us to the <a class="reference external" href="https://khanacademy.kilnhg.com/Repo/Website/Group/stable">Source
Link</a> i
have checked and tried getting kinhg account looks like it a paid site
and we need to pay after 45 days , my initial though before visiting
this site was to branch and maintain a tree there itself looks like it
is not as open as it claims. So the other option is to fork since the
code is anyway licensed under
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD2</a> lincense .</p>
<p>We are going to maintain two Repos one of Khanacademy ( KA) and one of
Fossacademy (FA) .</p>
<p>why maintain KA code , because initially when we start off as FA we will
have just KA code but over time it is going to differ and change in ways
, but also we will have some changes upstream in KA which we will be
needing from time to time to fix bugs which must have already crept in.</p>
<p>yes it is a overhead we have to live with for the time being .</p>
<p>coming back to the FA we will be maintaining the code on
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> , and everyone will pull from the
stable FA and start maintaining the FA trunkc or fork they will be free
to take the call .</p>
<p>on maintaining the dev environment , i found any variant of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a> to be a
good<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>
to maintain the code , you are free to maintain any IDE/Editor you are
comfortable with .</p>
<p>this video explains it all <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhBeXhZJMUw">Setting Dev
environment</a>using
eclipse .</p>
<p>i will be writing on the goals and specs for the project as we move
along keep watching this space ...</p>
