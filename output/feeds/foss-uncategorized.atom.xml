&lt;p&gt;not that i have been a great fan of this product apart from the initial
interest and hoopla i had , also one of the official test drives i took
as a consultant for a client of mine, now my predictions and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bit.ly/9dBu6p"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; are coming true , to start off have
you checked out the sources tried building it , have you seen the hue
and cry on the forums , have you heard of the hidden agenda in the name
of Foss all that is Dimdim was . yes it may have released some source on
SF but it did not have steam on its own to make it so they took the easy
route out....of redemption all else will be history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons for all other FOSS and not so Fossy companies , and young
enterpreneuers alike know your priorities if you want to come out with a
great FOSS product and want to exit at some point in time do so
gracefully , because at the end of the day you will be coming back to
FOSS community for new ideas and getting things done , i see a lot of
noise to become the Number one Foss company in the form of support or
product development has become the new buzz word in the last three years
of recession , many of these companies are going to go Dim Dim Dim way
so watch out this space for more.&lt;/p&gt;
