using crowd sourced way in India. so far the only way i have seen is the
by downloading and uploading a certain amount of data to the client and
measuring it. The features i am looking at in my app are as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) HTML 5 based : since it will run on all platforms , write once and
run it anywhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track the user ip for geocoding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;map the result in on a map : using leaflet library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am i a doing this ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) As a user we have seen many G's so far they are not reliable many
times and we do not have a record of these services not working or in
bad shape in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy makers can take certain decisions based on this raw data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile Companies can improve there services .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website initially will be self funded later stage i will seek some
funds from Govt , Companies or sources where they value these kind of
interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i in &amp;nbsp;talks
with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/anders94"&gt;anders94&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;html5speedtest.me
&amp;nbsp;he has agreed in principle to help me. Still i am not clear what
license his scripts are since he wrote it for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bandwidthplace.com"&gt;bandwidthplace&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been many efforts like these in past notable ones are
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://measurementlab.net/"&gt;measurement lab&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, i found there tools
to be outdated and use java applets . But the 6 Terabytes of hosted on
Google big data can be accesed using Big query for free. The other
interesting case was of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opensignal.com/"&gt;Opensignal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to
my surprise they actually got funded for 131 Millon dollars for this
effort ,never imagined you can make money from people's effort.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14644507"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;did a study of
its own using some of the Opensignal Data and there own data to do a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14644507"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;studying the
user base and the Signal strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now coming back to my part i am looking at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;nbsp;as a serious tech in the whole thing in my building a page to collect
the data.&lt;/p&gt;
