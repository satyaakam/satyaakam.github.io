have checked and tried getting kinhg account looks like it a paid site
and we need to pay after 45 days , my initial though before visiting
this site was to branch and maintain a tree there itself looks like it
is not as open as it claims. So the other option is to fork since the
code is anyway licensed under
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"&gt;BSD2&lt;/a&gt; lincense .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to maintain two Repos one of Khanacademy ( KA) and one of
Fossacademy (FA) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why maintain KA code , because initially when we start off as FA we will
have just KA code but over time it is going to differ and change in ways
, but also we will have some changes upstream in KA which we will be
needing from time to time to fix bugs which must have already crept in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes it is a overhead we have to live with for the time being .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coming back to the FA we will be maintaining the code on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/"&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; , and everyone will pull from the
stable FA and start maintaining the FA trunkc or fork they will be free
to take the call .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on maintaining the dev environment , i found any variant of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; to be a
good&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment"&gt;IDE&lt;/a&gt;
to maintain the code , you are free to maintain any IDE/Editor you are
comfortable with .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this video explains it all &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhBeXhZJMUw"&gt;Setting Dev
environment&lt;/a&gt;using
eclipse .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i will be writing on the goals and specs for the project as we move
along keep watching this space ...&lt;/p&gt;
