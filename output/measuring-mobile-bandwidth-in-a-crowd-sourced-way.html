  <div>
    <p>I have been dabbling with the idea of collating data from individuals
using crowd sourced way in India. so far the only way i have seen is the
by downloading and uploading a certain amount of data to the client and
measuring it. The features i am looking at in my app are as follows</p>
<p>1) HTML 5 based : since it will run on all platforms , write once and
run it anywhere</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Track the user ip for geocoding</li>
<li>map the result in on a map : using leaflet library</li>
</ol>
<p>Why am i a doing this ?</p>
<p>1) As a user we have seen many G's so far they are not reliable many
times and we do not have a record of these services not working or in
bad shape in some areas.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Policy makers can take certain decisions based on this raw data.</li>
<li>Mobile Companies can improve there services .</li>
</ol>
<p>This website initially will be self funded later stage i will seek some
funds from Govt , Companies or sources where they value these kind of
interventions.</p>
<p>i in &nbsp;talks
with&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/anders94">anders94</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;html5speedtest.me
&nbsp;he has agreed in principle to help me. Still i am not clear what
license his scripts are since he wrote it for
<a class="reference external" href="http://bandwidthplace.com">bandwidthplace</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>There has been many efforts like these in past notable ones are
<a class="reference external" href="http://measurementlab.net/">measurement lab</a>&nbsp;, i found there tools
to be outdated and use java applets . But the 6 Terabytes of hosted on
Google big data can be accesed using Big query for free. The other
interesting case was of the <a class="reference external" href="http://opensignal.com/">Opensignal</a>&nbsp;to
my surprise they actually got funded for 131 Millon dollars for this
effort ,never imagined you can make money from people's effort.
&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14644507">BBC</a>&nbsp;did a study of
its own using some of the Opensignal Data and there own data to do a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14644507">column</a>&nbsp;studying the
user base and the Signal strength.</p>
<p>Now coming back to my part i am looking at <a class="reference external" href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a>
&nbsp;as a serious tech in the whole thing in my building a page to collect
the data.</p>
