<p>, overall the visit has been fruitful saw sugar &#64; work kids discovering
and learning new things on there own , there were some 10 Xo's which
attracted around 200 kids from in and around the village.</p>
<p>The weather was too hot and dry i did not feel the humidity like Chennai
so suggested them to install water cooler . The most popular activities
were Paint , Wikipedia , lack to Internet is something which needs to be
looked into to get these kids talk out to the world.</p>
<p>on 20th the next day i visited one more school which is a govt school
which is under&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ssa.tn.nic.in/">Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan</a>
programme of govt of India , here i learned about the ABL ( activity
based learning ) which is similar to activity based in Sugar but it was
more structured in the sense of the kid goes from one class to other
after he has completed a set of activities in on subject or class. In
this school the four XO's are provided the programme is schedule to
begin after summer holidays.</p>
<p>things to be done in coming days , XO's need Sugar upgrade. Teachers
need training , identify kids who can teach other kids , get Internet
connection so that they can connect to the larger OLPC community .</p>
