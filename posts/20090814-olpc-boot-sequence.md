# OLPC boot sequence

Tried booting [ OLPC ](http://laptop.org) from USB , OLPC has a security feature to not boot from external devices by default , it comes with a security lock , we can remove this by a) Getting a Developer key b) Flashing the firmware The idea is to boot from USB device and run Ubuntu from USB then some apps over it, hope AMD processor with 256 MB of Ram can take all this.
