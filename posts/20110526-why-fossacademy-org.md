# Why Fossacademy.org ?

Hi, After looking at Khanacademy.org and following it  for few months now with both on development and content front i am convinced that if education , especially Foss education has to be done it can be done this way. i have been trolling  on sites  sites like [ShowMeDo](http://showmedo.com/) and [ Youtube ](http://www.youtube.com/) for quite a long now , and they have come up in a very good way content wise. The two things which Khan has done which is a good thing is 1) Monitoring students learning experience in the forms of coach 2) Assessing the students in the forms of tests 3) Knowledge maps  yes some of it i have seen some time back on [ Gnowledge](http://www.gnowledge.org/) but it did serve the pupose of self paced learning and assessment. to know about more features you can check out [Khanacademy.org ](http://www.khanacademy.org/about) Yes of course we cannot compare to the [Sal Khan's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan_%28educator%29) passion and delivery mode which i think is unique of  every teacher in this world. So why this post , yes i have started thinking on the lines of taking khanacademy.org code and making fossacademy.org with Foss content. the content is going to come from the following sources 
* [ShowMeDo](http://showmedo.com/)
* [ Youtube ](http://www.youtube.com/)
* [ Phpacademy](http://www.phpacademy.org/)
  
would like to add to the list more content sites as and when i start getting suggestions. for the folks who are interested in contributing and asking more questions i will be available on irc.freenode.net #fossacademy .
