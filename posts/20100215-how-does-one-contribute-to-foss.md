# How does one Contribute to FOSS?

This is one question has been asked on the web and the young people i meet day in and day out. They are all educated and literati of this world , still they have this Question How? and sometimes Why? i think it all starts with giving or so called sense of sharing without any expectations , i think that's the key to it all . This all starts with sharing your thoughts , ideas and writings you actually are on the path to contributing , because in Foss Communities collaborations is they key to the sucessÂ  of an idea. lets examine these in more detail hopefully people who ask these questions will get there answers somewhere or never since it takes time and energy to let go your Old Habits and relearn the new ones, the best document i have come so far in this direction is from [Gnubie ](http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/gnubie.html)
