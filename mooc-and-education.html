    <p>Education and learning are terms used synonymously&nbsp;, i agree with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~emurphy/stemnet/papert.html">Seymour Papert</a>
and the people who have been influenced over decades by his writings.</p>
<p>last few years i have been &nbsp;seeing a lots of buzz around the word
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a> ,
just few years before the &nbsp;term like
&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning">Elearning</a>&nbsp;had a similar
effect on us &nbsp;. Initially all the&nbsp;entrepreneurial&nbsp;kinds tried to
capitalize this rush using technologies in last two decade like Flash
etc and&nbsp;everyone's&nbsp;focus was on the content and selling this content in
the digital formats in India too there has been efforts , they were
basically digitizing all the textbooks and were calling it Elearning.</p>
<p>then came the craze of devices like
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">OLPC</a>&nbsp;in 2006 , i
learned about it around 2007&nbsp;, The idea was started will all good
intentions but it had its own flaws in the model and approach &nbsp;, you can
learn about the current status of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://one.laptop.org/">project</a>&nbsp;here . The two contributions i see
from this projects are&nbsp;Netbooks , Tablets frenzy and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sugarlabs.org/">Sugar
Environment</a> , which again are ideas which
are way ahead of time , when people are still stuck on there Elearning
mentality . all of a sudden the combo of hardware and software for a
digitized classroom became so important as though the world is going to
end tomorrow. Elearning companies popped up some of them made it through
this gold rush too.</p>
<p>at this point i would like to differentiate between Education and
Learning , The so called form has changed from television to computers
and &nbsp;now to internet . all that has been happening is so far in
&nbsp;education is sort of push in the education terms .</p>
<p>Enter MOOC's&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> ,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> ,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> , <a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/">Edx</a>
,<a class="reference external" href="http://www.p2pu.org">p2p</a> ,
<a class="reference external" href="%20http://www.udemy.com%20">Udemy</a>&nbsp;are some good examples of these
here &nbsp;again a wild rush to capitalize and transform the education sector
into an open play ground . Traditional universities have all joined in
&nbsp;the race too .i feel because of over growing pressure to increase the
base and &nbsp;reduce the capital expenditure they feel , this is it the holy
grail to fix education &nbsp;.</p>
<p>There are two of MOOC's &nbsp;happening here one is a unstructured and the
other is structured around to fit the traditional education &nbsp;, the
content is good , exams and tests are all conducted on a scheduled way
in the structured form of delivery .</p>
<p>i did hacking around last year to make a clone of called
<a class="reference external" href="http://satyaakam.net/2011/10/24/fork-from-fossacademy/">Fossacademy</a>,
now i
see&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/">course-builder</a>&nbsp;is
based out of it too , i have looked&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="p2pu.org">p2p</a>&nbsp;code base&nbsp;&nbsp;,
the good thing them is they have a way to give students exercies and
measure there learning while they are enrolled to the courses , but the
approach i like the most so far has been the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism">Social
&nbsp;contructivism&nbsp;</a>
and a good example of it find the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open source
culture</a>&nbsp;way
and project like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/%20">nand2tetris</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>So what is happening to Education well its happening and places of
learning have started to pop up too in the name of New Age schools ,
since we need to re look at the way our next generations are going to
learn from things around them .</p>
