    <p>We turned up at the announced event through the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/356533261121579/">facebook events
page</a>, had no clue
who the organizers were and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.schoolofconvergence.com/">place</a> we were going to . The
page just mentioned about telling stories with data. Staying with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://datameet.org/">open data</a>&nbsp;community i had a clue of what was
coming , but did not have a clear agenda or plan of action for next few
hours we were going to stay at the meetup.One of the datasets i have
been hearing about a lot past few months &nbsp;is from the data.gov.in
website , since my rendevous with the Open Data from govt has been
limited to the public data available through
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.chalobest.in">chalobest.in</a> project , this project still
has not been realized in &nbsp;NCR area. Anyway the place was a buzz with
people of all age groups mostly students from journalism and activists
too . we all sat in small groups either talking about an idea or data
set we would be working on . Since i was interested in the data sets
from Govt , we picked the <a class="reference external" href="http://data.gov.in/dataset/infant-mortality-rate-imr">infant mortality
rate&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;it was
in CSV format , the big picture was to create a Heatmap out of &nbsp;the
data&nbsp;available&nbsp;, the first thing we noticed was there were not lat longs
for the states , so two members from team &#64;arcolife &nbsp;and Myself sat down
with the site<a class="reference external" href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames.org</a>to collect
&nbsp;the same , in the meantime &#64;bhanuvrat , &#64;kanteshraj were writing
scripts to the data transformed &nbsp;in the format required . Ramniq was our
anchor man who was putting everything together , he started of with the
Heatmap code , initially he was dablling with Openlayers later we
switched to Leaflet which was much easier to code in . Overall at the
end of it we produced the following heat map .</p>
<img alt="heatmap" class="align-center" src="../images/heatmap.png" style="width: 600px; height: 500px;" />
<p>which was sort of hardcoded and &nbsp;static one with the limitations of time
we could produce here is the code for the
&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/ramniquesingh/heatmap-demo/src">Heatmap</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The experience has been good for everyone since we we were getting
together after longtime and produced something in the end. Scope for
improvements we can cover more years with &nbsp;a time line kind of interface
and really see it visually which is kind of nice than just some dry
numbers on a spread sheet . We dispersed with lots of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.476488175739797&amp;type=1">sweet
memories</a>&nbsp;and
hope to have more such events in future.</p>
