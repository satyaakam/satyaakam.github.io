<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="http://fossevents.in">Fossevents.in</a> is coming up nicely , it has
been lying dormant for almost a year now it has seen some day of the
light thanks to the support from community .</div>

</div>
<p>my vision of fossevents.in was only one and when we started , i was away
from organizing and running community activities for long and when i
came back i see the landscape has totally changed , there are events
happening all around you and you are not aware of the event which could
be happening right there in your neighbourhood.</p>
<p>my definition of an event is anything which is related to foss it can be
workshop, meeting , hackathons, training programs actually this was not
my idea of calling an foss event an event but slowly i realized that
these events are in no way less or more than others so they deserve a
mention on fossevents.in .</p>
