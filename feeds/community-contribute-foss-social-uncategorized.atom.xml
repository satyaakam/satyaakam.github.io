to measure Newcomer experience for people who have &amp;nbsp;joined and any &amp;nbsp;of
the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Debian, FreeBSD (including PC-BSD),&amp;nbsp;GNOME,
Gentoo,&amp;nbsp;**KDE,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Mozilla, Ubuntu, NetBSD, or OpenSUSE&amp;nbsp;** in last
three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey is available
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://limesurvey.sim.vuw.ac.nz/index.php?sid=65151&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;,The
good thing about this survey is it is all anonymous and the Data will be
shared in open&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the latest result of
his&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kevincarillo.org/2012/11/15/survey-update-after-1-week/%20"&gt;Survey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;after
one week of this survey going public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side Students with &amp;nbsp;Formal Education in Schools and Colleges
complain about the &amp;nbsp;not getting jobs and on the other side the system
being very conservative in there approach towards FOSS. i have been
working on the aspect of how to get a Newbie to get to speed to
contribute and get a job at the end of it ,since working in FOSS
communities they develop certain work ethics and experience which are
invaluable in real life scenarios , mostly in the FOSS world people do
not get Employed because what they are good at but the valuable skills
they get by doing FOSS work , this is something with which no formal
training or teaching can give them , Employers are just seeking or
wanting that part of it , so i warn students many a times to keep there
passion and profession seperate in order to avoid conflicting situations
, mostly &amp;nbsp;i have seen students want to Join the FOSS communitues with
different motivations and expectations , i classify them mainly into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jobs seekers &amp;nbsp; : around &amp;nbsp;95 %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprenuers : 2-3 %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributors &amp;nbsp; : 2 %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my approach in classifying is very simple check out if they are under
any financial &amp;nbsp;pressure , can there family support there choice
financially if not send them to Jobs in the industry they can always
come back once they become more stable and hope in future they will turn
back to become 2 or 3 kinds . I tend to have and focus most of my
energies on making the 2 or 3 kinds .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking abour skills development the&amp;nbsp;unstructured&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;way has been going on
for years , recently i saw &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://openhatch.org/"&gt;Openhatch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;just
trying to do that in a very structured way&amp;nbsp;, i will be supporting it and
will be talking more and more about it in near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/soc/"&gt;Google SOC&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;nbsp;one other programme i
have been following since inception , The general perception is not many
of the GSOC students stick with the projects , or the spirit of
Innovation or greater good , most of them are happy with using this as a
ticket to &amp;nbsp;jobs , In India money is the other motivating factor , i have
seen such a programme much before SOC was run by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sarai.net/fellowships/floss"&gt;Sarai&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;they had this
programme for supporting the practitioners with an intent of doing
public good .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foss communities have come a long way in last two decades i have
been associated with them now &amp;nbsp;the Local User groups are trying to
reinvent themselves and move away from being only certain GNU/Linux
Distro oriented communities there are now cluster of communities in the
form of languages , content management systems, cloud software and
&amp;nbsp;anything you can think of no wonder that proves we have come a long
way. Communities too have there life and they evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coming back to surveys these kind of impartial studies are very
important , Other survey ideas which i have been thinking about are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Till date we still do not have numbers on how many Foss users around
the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My personal interest has been to come out with a survey to measure
how much value &amp;nbsp;( by value i do not just mean money ) FOSS has added
to ones skills apart from the formal education in his career , i do
not know what can be the criteria and how to measure it :-(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
