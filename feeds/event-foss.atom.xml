aka #ddm happened as a typical community event , others pitched in to
contribute , learn and win some prizes . Overall there was lots of fun
at the end of the day. Energy levels were high apart from the well known
names the surprise part to the event were folks from Glug Meerut. For
new faces i will consider folks from from Kashmir. Some
