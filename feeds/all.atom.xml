Overall the takes from the projects are the team is amazing to work with
, with in few days i was using the line &amp;quot;i work for a start up called
data.gov.in&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;the iterations were real quick and the energy levels were
high. i managed to make tons of connect and good friends at the end of
it all . All the projects in the final are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://iic.ac.in/projects/"&gt;posted
here&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;. Working on a final film on what
has transpired in the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cryptoparty.in"&gt;Cryptoparties&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;While we were doing the
project with Delhi university there we also organized few crypto parties
notably &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cryptoparty.in/delhi-2013-07"&gt;this one&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;which
was a nightout affair in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://iic.ac.in"&gt;IIC&lt;/a&gt;Delhi university

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.open-steps.org/meeting-workshop-ncr-delhi-india/"&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Month of July was announced a Python month keeping in view the then
upcoming &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2013/"&gt;Pycon India&lt;/a&gt;we were able to do

.I have to miss the Pycon India this year due to the data.gov.in
commitment , looking forward to attending one next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the things which i missed most in the last few months are my

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Over the last two decades i had the&amp;nbsp;privilege&amp;nbsp; to learn and teach many
people from the Foss community . one of the mantras i learned from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adempiere.com/"&gt;Adempiere&lt;/a&gt;community especially from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://red1.org/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Redhuan D. Oon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is where he defines and
consolidates what a community means to him in three lines.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; A NEW CONSTITUTION &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Is Free&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;... U HAVE 2 KNOW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People Are Not&amp;nbsp;... U HAVE 2 PAY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributors Are Priceless&amp;nbsp;... U HAVE 2 BE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i for one has been lucky in this life to meet and work with &amp;nbsp;more of the
third kinds , today when we see the generation X , &amp;nbsp;we see a Gap in the
understanding of the spirit and the doubt towards what this is all about
. i have decided to compile a book with these stories in order to
encourage young students of genx as an inspiration to become &amp;nbsp;the third
kinds. i am looking for people either themselves or &amp;nbsp;there stories of
pains and pleasures to be documented for the next generations to come.
do suggest me or get in touch with me if you want anyone from the
community to be covered in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

Collaboration with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nic.in/"&gt;NIC&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;especially the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.data.gov.in/"&gt;Data.gov.in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Team&amp;nbsp;( which is &amp;nbsp;setup
according to the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://data.gov.in/sites/default/files/NDSAP_Implementation_Guidelines-2.0.pdf"&gt;NDSAP&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;guildelines)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;organized
a Hackathon to hack the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://12thplan.gov.in/"&gt;12th five year
plan&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for those of who are not aware like
most of us &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-Year_plans_of_India"&gt;Five years plans in
India&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are
economic blueprints &amp;nbsp;from Planning&amp;nbsp;Commission&amp;nbsp;as to how are are going to
spend in Next Five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were at the venue around 11am , when things were still settling down
at the Venue &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.iitd.ac.in/"&gt;IIT Delhi&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, we were supposed
to be connected to the live webconference in the opening ceremony but
due to connectivity issues we were able to just watch the broadcast ,
but being in Delhi it was ok since there were frequent visit by
&amp;nbsp;organizers just to check on how things were progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the whole commotion we sat in a corner and started talking about what
to build we were froze on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/geohacker/12th-plan/blob/master/geohackers_presentation.pdf"&gt;Build your Plan
&amp;nbsp;idea&lt;/a&gt;
at around 2 Pm and started working on it there were two classrooms 6LT1
and 6LT2 allocated for us to sit and complete the work in the meantime
there were announcements and updates presentation from different sectors
as to what there
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planningcommission.nic.in/hackathon/index.php"&gt;expectations&lt;/a&gt;were
as to this Hackathon , it was almost 5 Pm by the time others settled
down and started the work in the meantime we were done with front end of
our application. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/geohacker"&gt;Sajjad&lt;/a&gt;and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/RamniqueSingh"&gt;Ramnique&lt;/a&gt;coded the front end in
two session one sitting in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cafeqahwa.in/"&gt;Cafe&amp;nbsp;Qahwa&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;.
We realized we were not productive enough so we moved back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day two we were all supposed to submit the applications by 12 in the
noon and the presentations would be starting from 2 PM , &amp;nbsp;we pushed the
submit button just in nick of time with Sajjad Ramnique and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/ajantriks"&gt;Sumandro
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a hardly any blink whole night
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First on the block were us Sumandro presented our idea and the Jury was
interactive and liked out idea . Here is the link to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geohacker.github.io/12th-plan"&gt;Build Your
App&lt;/a&gt; the live application
.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;we hung around the venue till late in the evening till all the
presentations were over .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="build1" class="align-center" src="../images/build1.png" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the user plays with his allocations he will get different
scenarios showing how his plan will look.This he can share with people
which they can vote on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;overall the experience has been a positive one with some scope for
improvements like the internet connectivity was bad we were using our
own 3G phones as access points . Students were not equipped and educated
to what was expected from the event. Lots of disturbance with the so
called VIP's visiting the venue now and then. No proper place to sleep
yes people who hung out at the Venue were defending mosquitoes rather
than building something .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being first one for the Govt it must have been and educational
experience , they also need to involve and publicize the event more in
the public like they do to there Schemes in the Newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Team geohackers with Montek&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here are some of the moments in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://t.co/iC5o7pfhnW"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt;
and all the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.data.gov.in/hackathon/winners"&gt;winners&lt;/a&gt;
listed here , i wished they have put the list of all the people no
matter how small the effort was because in an event like this everyone
benefits and everyone is a winner.&lt;/p&gt;

page&lt;/a&gt;, had no clue
who the organizers were and the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.schoolofconvergence.com/"&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; we were going to . The
page just mentioned about telling stories with data. Staying with the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://datameet.org/"&gt;open data&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;community i had a clue of what was
coming , but did not have a clear agenda or plan of action for next few
hours we were going to stay at the meetup.One of the datasets i have
been hearing about a lot past few months &amp;nbsp;is from the data.gov.in
website , since my rendevous with the Open Data from govt has been
limited to the public data available through
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chalobest.in"&gt;chalobest.in&lt;/a&gt; project , this project still
has not been realized in &amp;nbsp;NCR area. Anyway the place was a buzz with
people of all age groups mostly students from journalism and activists
too . we all sat in small groups either talking about an idea or data
set we would be working on . Since i was interested in the data sets
from Govt , we picked the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://data.gov.in/dataset/infant-mortality-rate-imr"&gt;infant mortality
rate&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;it was
in CSV format , the big picture was to create a Heatmap out of &amp;nbsp;the
data&amp;nbsp;available&amp;nbsp;, the first thing we noticed was there were not lat longs
for the states , so two members from team &amp;#64;arcolife &amp;nbsp;and Myself sat down
with the site&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.geonames.org/"&gt;Geonames.org&lt;/a&gt;to collect
&amp;nbsp;the same , in the meantime &amp;#64;bhanuvrat , &amp;#64;kanteshraj were writing
scripts to the data transformed &amp;nbsp;in the format required . Ramniq was our
anchor man who was putting everything together , he started of with the
Heatmap code , initially he was dablling with Openlayers later we
switched to Leaflet which was much easier to code in . Overall at the
end of it we produced the following heat map .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="heatmap" class="align-center" src="../images/heatmap.png" style="width: 600px; height: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which was sort of hardcoded and &amp;nbsp;static one with the limitations of time
we could produce here is the code for the
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/ramniquesingh/heatmap-demo/src"&gt;Heatmap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience has been good for everyone since we we were getting
together after longtime and produced something in the end. Scope for
improvements we can cover more years with &amp;nbsp;a time line kind of interface
and really see it visually which is kind of nice than just some dry
numbers on a spread sheet . We dispersed with lots of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.476488175739797&amp;amp;type=1"&gt;sweet
memories&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
hope to have more such events in future.&lt;/p&gt;

to measure Newcomer experience for people who have &amp;nbsp;joined and any &amp;nbsp;of
the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Debian, FreeBSD (including PC-BSD),&amp;nbsp;GNOME,
Gentoo,&amp;nbsp;**KDE,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Mozilla, Ubuntu, NetBSD, or OpenSUSE&amp;nbsp;** in last
three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey is available
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://limesurvey.sim.vuw.ac.nz/index.php?sid=65151&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;,The
good thing about this survey is it is all anonymous and the Data will be
shared in open&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the latest result of
his&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kevincarillo.org/2012/11/15/survey-update-after-1-week/%20"&gt;Survey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;after
one week of this survey going public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side Students with &amp;nbsp;Formal Education in Schools and Colleges
complain about the &amp;nbsp;not getting jobs and on the other side the system
being very conservative in there approach towards FOSS. i have been
working on the aspect of how to get a Newbie to get to speed to
contribute and get a job at the end of it ,since working in FOSS
communities they develop certain work ethics and experience which are
invaluable in real life scenarios , mostly in the FOSS world people do
not get Employed because what they are good at but the valuable skills
they get by doing FOSS work , this is something with which no formal
training or teaching can give them , Employers are just seeking or
wanting that part of it , so i warn students many a times to keep there
passion and profession seperate in order to avoid conflicting situations
, mostly &amp;nbsp;i have seen students want to Join the FOSS communitues with
different motivations and expectations , i classify them mainly into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jobs seekers &amp;nbsp; : around &amp;nbsp;95 %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprenuers : 2-3 %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributors &amp;nbsp; : 2 %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my approach in classifying is very simple check out if they are under
any financial &amp;nbsp;pressure , can there family support there choice
financially if not send them to Jobs in the industry they can always
come back once they become more stable and hope in future they will turn
back to become 2 or 3 kinds . I tend to have and focus most of my
energies on making the 2 or 3 kinds .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking abour skills development the&amp;nbsp;unstructured&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;way has been going on
for years , recently i saw &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://openhatch.org/"&gt;Openhatch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;just
trying to do that in a very structured way&amp;nbsp;, i will be supporting it and
will be talking more and more about it in near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/soc/"&gt;Google SOC&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;nbsp;one other programme i
have been following since inception , The general perception is not many
of the GSOC students stick with the projects , or the spirit of
Innovation or greater good , most of them are happy with using this as a
ticket to &amp;nbsp;jobs , In India money is the other motivating factor , i have
seen such a programme much before SOC was run by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sarai.net/fellowships/floss"&gt;Sarai&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;they had this
programme for supporting the practitioners with an intent of doing
public good .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foss communities have come a long way in last two decades i have
been associated with them now &amp;nbsp;the Local User groups are trying to
reinvent themselves and move away from being only certain GNU/Linux
Distro oriented communities there are now cluster of communities in the
form of languages , content management systems, cloud software and
&amp;nbsp;anything you can think of no wonder that proves we have come a long
way. Communities too have there life and they evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coming back to surveys these kind of impartial studies are very
important , Other survey ideas which i have been thinking about are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Till date we still do not have numbers on how many Foss users around
the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My personal interest has been to come out with a survey to measure
how much value &amp;nbsp;( by value i do not just mean money ) FOSS has added
to ones skills apart from the formal education in his career , i do
not know what can be the criteria and how to measure it :-(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~emurphy/stemnet/papert.html"&gt;Seymour Papert&lt;/a&gt;
and the people who have been influenced over decades by his writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last few years i have been &amp;nbsp;seeing a lots of buzz around the word
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course"&gt;MOOC&lt;/a&gt; ,
just few years before the &amp;nbsp;term like
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning"&gt;Elearning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;had a similar
effect on us &amp;nbsp;. Initially all the&amp;nbsp;entrepreneurial&amp;nbsp;kinds tried to
capitalize this rush using technologies in last two decade like Flash
etc and&amp;nbsp;everyone's&amp;nbsp;focus was on the content and selling this content in
the digital formats in India too there has been efforts , they were
basically digitizing all the textbooks and were calling it Elearning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then came the craze of devices like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child"&gt;OLPC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in 2006 , i
learned about it around 2007&amp;nbsp;, The idea was started will all good
intentions but it had its own flaws in the model and approach &amp;nbsp;, you can
learn about the current status of the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://one.laptop.org/"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;here . The two contributions i see
from this projects are&amp;nbsp;Netbooks , Tablets frenzy and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sugarlabs.org/"&gt;Sugar
Environment&lt;/a&gt; , which again are ideas which
are way ahead of time , when people are still stuck on there Elearning
mentality . all of a sudden the combo of hardware and software for a
digitized classroom became so important as though the world is going to
end tomorrow. Elearning companies popped up some of them made it through
this gold rush too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at this point i would like to differentiate between Education and
Learning , The so called form has changed from television to computers
and &amp;nbsp;now to internet . all that has been happening is so far in
&amp;nbsp;education is sort of push in the education terms .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter MOOC's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.khanacademy.org/"&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt; ,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; ,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.udacity.com/"&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/"&gt;Edx&lt;/a&gt;
,&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.p2pu.org"&gt;p2p&lt;/a&gt; ,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="%20http://www.udemy.com%20"&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are some good examples of these
here &amp;nbsp;again a wild rush to capitalize and transform the education sector
into an open play ground . Traditional universities have all joined in
&amp;nbsp;the race too .i feel because of over growing pressure to increase the
base and &amp;nbsp;reduce the capital expenditure they feel , this is it the holy
grail to fix education &amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two of MOOC's &amp;nbsp;happening here one is a unstructured and the
other is structured around to fit the traditional education &amp;nbsp;, the
content is good , exams and tests are all conducted on a scheduled way
in the structured form of delivery .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i did hacking around last year to make a clone of called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://satyaakam.net/2011/10/24/fork-from-fossacademy/"&gt;Fossacademy&lt;/a&gt;,
now i
see&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/"&gt;course-builder&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is
based out of it too , i have looked&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="p2pu.org"&gt;p2p&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;code base&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;,
the good thing them is they have a way to give students exercies and
measure there learning while they are enrolled to the courses , but the
approach i like the most so far has been the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism"&gt;Social
&amp;nbsp;contructivism&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;
and a good example of it find the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software"&gt;Free and Open source
culture&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;way
and project like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/%20"&gt;nand2tetris&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is happening to Education well its happening and places of
learning have started to pop up too in the name of New Age schools ,
since we need to re look at the way our next generations are going to
learn from things around them .&lt;/p&gt;

using crowd sourced way in India. so far the only way i have seen is the
by downloading and uploading a certain amount of data to the client and
measuring it. The features i am looking at in my app are as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) HTML 5 based : since it will run on all platforms , write once and
run it anywhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track the user ip for geocoding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;map the result in on a map : using leaflet library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am i a doing this ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) As a user we have seen many G's so far they are not reliable many
times and we do not have a record of these services not working or in
bad shape in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy makers can take certain decisions based on this raw data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile Companies can improve there services .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website initially will be self funded later stage i will seek some
funds from Govt , Companies or sources where they value these kind of
interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i in &amp;nbsp;talks
with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/anders94"&gt;anders94&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;html5speedtest.me
&amp;nbsp;he has agreed in principle to help me. Still i am not clear what
license his scripts are since he wrote it for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bandwidthplace.com"&gt;bandwidthplace&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been many efforts like these in past notable ones are
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://measurementlab.net/"&gt;measurement lab&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, i found there tools
to be outdated and use java applets . But the 6 Terabytes of hosted on
Google big data can be accesed using Big query for free. The other
interesting case was of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opensignal.com/"&gt;Opensignal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to
my surprise they actually got funded for 131 Millon dollars for this
effort ,never imagined you can make money from people's effort.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14644507"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;did a study of
its own using some of the Opensignal Data and there own data to do a

user base and the Signal strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now coming back to my part i am looking at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;nbsp;as a serious tech in the whole thing in my building a page to collect

system and our young tender years in school.Why do one has to be
rewarded only for passing or not to fail ? Why is passing so important
for ones well being because with that he does not learn much while one
fails he learns a lot. Why are kids who experiment and hence commit
mistakes &amp;nbsp;abhored as wrong when what they are doing is at least trying .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same pattern emerges when we grow up into young adults where being
sucessful becomes so obessesive that people go to any length to be so
called &amp;nbsp;succesful , what i am saying is it's not bad to be desiring for
sucess but the way it's played out is not ok . We as a society has laid
a wrong precident in the young minds trying to so impinging our values
and belief systems on them and how to fail is bad and sucess is the only
way to Learn .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Kid in this world has a moral right to fail because that's the
only way we Humans learn if you stop that i think it's an impediment to
ones learning process and ultimately shows about the society and times
we are living in , where in the name of competition Students are under
tremendous pressure and loose the whole point of Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So learning to fail and learning from failing should be our motto...
think&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/khanacademy/wiki/Source?tm=4"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; , the
link from here will point us to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://khanacademy.kilnhg.com/Repo/Website/Group/stable"&gt;Source
Link&lt;/a&gt; i
have checked and tried getting kinhg account looks like it a paid site
and we need to pay after 45 days , my initial though before visiting
this site was to branch and maintain a tree there itself looks like it
is not as open as it claims. So the other option is to fork since the
code is anyway licensed under
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"&gt;BSD2&lt;/a&gt; lincense .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to maintain two Repos one of Khanacademy ( KA) and one of
Fossacademy (FA) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why maintain KA code , because initially when we start off as FA we will
have just KA code but over time it is going to differ and change in ways
, but also we will have some changes upstream in KA which we will be
needing from time to time to fix bugs which must have already crept in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes it is a overhead we have to live with for the time being .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coming back to the FA we will be maintaining the code on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/"&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; , and everyone will pull from the
stable FA and start maintaining the FA trunkc or fork they will be free
to take the call .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on maintaining the dev environment , i found any variant of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; to be a
good&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment"&gt;IDE&lt;/a&gt;
to maintain the code , you are free to maintain any IDE/Editor you are
comfortable with .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Hi,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;After looking at Khanacademy.org and following it &amp;nbsp;for few months now
with both on development and content front i am convinced that if
education , especially Foss education has to be done it can be done
this way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have been trolling &amp;nbsp;on sites &amp;nbsp;sites like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://showmedo.com/"&gt;ShowMeDo&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt; for quite a long now , and they
have come up in a very good way content wise. The two things which Khan
has done which is a good thing is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1) Monitoring students learning experience in the forms of coach&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2) Assessing the students in the forms of tests&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;3) Knowledge maps &amp;nbsp;yes some of it i have seen some time back on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnowledge.org/"&gt;Gnowledge&lt;/a&gt; but it did serve the pupose
of self paced learning and assessment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to know about more features you can check out
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.khanacademy.org/about"&gt;Khanacademy.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes of course we cannot compare to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan_%28educator%29"&gt;Sal
Khan's&lt;/a&gt;
passion and delivery mode which i think is unique of &amp;nbsp;every teacher in
this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why this post , yes i have started thinking on the lines of taking
khanacademy.org code and making fossacademy.org with Foss content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the content is going to come from the following sources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://showmedo.com/"&gt;ShowMeDo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpacademy.org/"&gt;Phpacademy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would like to add to the list more content sites as and when i start
getting suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for the folks who are interested in contributing and asking more
questions i will be available on irc.freenode.net #fossacademy .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;off late things have become busy , not that you the reader are
idealing and reading this post of mine out or boredom or drudgery,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fossevents.in"&gt;Fossevents.in&lt;/a&gt; is coming up nicely , it has
been lying dormant for almost a year now it has seen some day of the
light thanks to the support from community .&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my vision of fossevents.in was only one and when we started , i was away
from organizing and running community activities for long and when i
came back i see the landscape has totally changed , there are events
happening all around you and you are not aware of the event which could
be happening right there in your neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my definition of an event is anything which is related to foss it can be
workshop, meeting , hackathons, training programs actually this was not
my idea of calling an foss event an event but slowly i realized that
these events are in no way less or more than others so they deserve a
mention on fossevents.in .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dimdim has been acquired by salesforce.com. Your free Dimdim account
will remain active until March 15, 2011. After that date, you will no
longer be able to access your free Dimdim account.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not that i have been a great fan of this product apart from the initial
interest and hoopla i had , also one of the official test drives i took
as a consultant for a client of mine, now my predictions and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/9dBu6p"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; are coming true , to start off have
you checked out the sources tried building it , have you seen the hue
and cry on the forums , have you heard of the hidden agenda in the name
of Foss all that is Dimdim was . yes it may have released some source on
SF but it did not have steam on its own to make it so they took the easy
route out....of redemption all else will be history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons for all other FOSS and not so Fossy companies , and young
enterpreneuers alike know your priorities if you want to come out with a
great FOSS product and want to exit at some point in time do so
gracefully , because at the end of the day you will be coming back to
FOSS community for new ideas and getting things done , i see a lot of
noise to become the Number one Foss company in the form of support or
product development has become the new buzz word in the last three years
of recession , many of these companies are going to go Dim Dim Dim way
so watch out this space for more.&lt;/p&gt;

FaceBook , Linked in , or any of the social networking sites , do you
make friends then meet or friend is just a number game for you , are
these social networking sites really helping the Family and society as a
unit together or its just an extension to say hi to everyone and giving
updates on status of your social well being ? is FB just an extension to
good old community living or just a way to survive in a &amp;nbsp;world where
connecting and meeting folks on FB is just an easy way that &amp;nbsp;you have
accepted and want to continue. What is your &amp;nbsp;the definition of being
socially active ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to the good old Sarai's and community programs do they
still exist or taken a new avatar and use FaceBook as only a platform ,
what happened to our good old Linux Users Groups
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.linux-india.org/"&gt;http://www.linux-india.org/&lt;/a&gt; LUG's are they thriving because of a New
tool in the form of social networking sites or they just don't exist
anymore , or they have lost somewhere in middle in all the noise try to
to find a meaning of Community .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the FOSS as a technology has matured enough and has been
embraced &amp;nbsp;by industry, and the level of bifurcation or so called
specialization has reached &amp;nbsp;a stage &amp;nbsp;where in we need specific users
groups like firefox , open office , Coders,Admins , Activist so on and
so forth , i see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gtugs.org/"&gt;http://www.gtugs.org/&lt;/a&gt; too &amp;nbsp;poping up and discussusions
floating around on &amp;nbsp;LUG mailing lists &amp;nbsp;about have jquery or
Drupal/Wordpress sessions actually Jermy allision and chris di bona
talks about this phenomenon in this
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBIFY6OGMBg"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;too. I see this
phenomenon happening in India also &amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the meaning of being social or community is getting into &amp;nbsp;smaller
groups with focus on few things and more towards mechanization of
something like assembly like with folks doing smaller tasks in big
numbers and other things like Internet , distributions , email , irc ,
FaceBook will be taken granted for that they will not be meeting too
often physically untill and unless some project demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, overall the visit has been fruitful saw sugar &amp;#64; work kids discovering
and learning new things on there own , there were some 10 Xo's which
attracted around 200 kids from in and around the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was too hot and dry i did not feel the humidity like Chennai
so suggested them to install water cooler . The most popular activities
were Paint , Wikipedia , lack to Internet is something which needs to be
looked into to get these kids talk out to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on 20th the next day i visited one more school which is a govt school
which is under&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ssa.tn.nic.in/"&gt;Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan&lt;/a&gt;
programme of govt of India , here i learned about the ABL ( activity
based learning ) which is similar to activity based in Sugar but it was
more structured in the sense of the kid goes from one class to other
after he has completed a set of activities in on subject or class. In
this school the four XO's are provided the programme is schedule to
begin after summer holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;things to be done in coming days , XO's need Sugar upgrade. Teachers
need training , identify kids who can teach other kids , get Internet
connection so that they can connect to the larger OLPC community .&lt;/p&gt;

meet day in and day out. They are all educated and literati of this
world , still they have this Question How? and sometimes Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i think it all starts with giving or so called sense of sharing without
any expectations , i think that's the key to it all . This all starts
with sharing your thoughts , ideas and writings you actually are on the
path to contributing , because in Foss Communities collaborations is
they key to the sucess&amp;nbsp; of an idea. lets examine these in more detail
hopefully people who ask these questions will get there answers
somewhere or never since it takes time and energy to let go your Old
Habits and relearn the new ones, the best document i have come so far in
this direction is from

Benq&lt;/a&gt;
i bought myself a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.benq.co.in/products/joybook/?product=1503"&gt;gift for New
Year&lt;/a&gt; Joybook
Lite U 121 Eco from Nehru Place, New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually the itch has been going on for long after reading reviews on
various mailing lists in India, it was evident that finding a Netbook
with GNU/Linux installed would be a tough bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an eye on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.acer.co.in/acer/seu30e.do?LanguageISOCtxParam=hi&amp;amp;link=ln374e&amp;amp;CountryISOCtxParam=IN&amp;amp;acond125e=57989&amp;amp;kcond48e.c2att101=57989&amp;amp;sp=page17e&amp;amp;ctx1g.c2att92=867&amp;amp;ctx2.c2att1=158&amp;amp;ctx1.att21k=1&amp;amp;CRC=1620424451"&gt;Acer One
D250&lt;/a&gt;
for long. But it was a no no after reading this presentation by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tree.celinuxforum.org/CelfPubWiki/ELCEurope2009Presentations?action=AttachFile&amp;amp;do=get⌖=Mythbusters_Android.pdf"&gt;Matt
Porter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i strongly recommend for all the mobile developers to consider reading
this before diving into the Android way of undoing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok coming back to the story of why Benq all in the world , since Acer
was already ruled out and Asus had some good recommendations , Benq was
definitely was not on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had a look at the two Joy Book models one was with smaller screen and
lesser hard disk space , the other was recommended by the marketing guy
as it came with Linpus .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linpus still does not connect me to the Net , i called up there office
had to go round in circles aka musical chairs, but still i wanted to
taste first hand reasons why folks don't make GNU/Linux based Netbooks
or Laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer i suppose is a well know one in FOSS world &amp;quot;Support&amp;quot; , i am
still exploring and finding how the OEM is tied to Linpus and what
support aggrement i am entitled to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the meantime i did not want to install any other OS and get online
ASAP since i am still exploring and expecting some form of decent
support from the Vendor ;-( , more on that later...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime i had a liveusb with Ubuntu 9.10 to test the wifi, it
too does not work out of the box , i got it working working by inserting
rt kernel module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;$sudo su -&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;#modprobe rt3070sta&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enabled the network by pressing function key and F10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;a) Getting a Developer key&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;b) Flashing the firmware&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adempiere.org"&gt;adempiere&lt;/a&gt; community to use. once the
accounts for people are created you can access it using a voip softphone
or a hard phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the service we can currently conference, and call extensions for
free. Mike have the servers located in data centre in London which has
plenty of bandwidth. (1,000GB/month) he has some inbound UK numbers
which can be routed through different call groups and queues. You can
schedule timezones and only route to certain extensions at certain times
of the day (so as not to wake you up at night).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no outbound calling (as that costs money), but he
can add additional telephone numbers for different countries and route
them directly to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who want to join the system will be able to call and transfer
calls to each other - so this could be used as a collaboration tool for
support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike is presently looking for other interested parties to try this out -
please contact michael dot judd at akunagroup dot com if you are
interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tested it using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ekiga.org"&gt;Ekiga&lt;/a&gt; on 256 Kbps
bandwidth from Airtel Broadband services , it works well some screen

&lt;div class="line"&gt;You can try the following numbers:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;102 - Mike Judd&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;304 - Satyag&lt;/div&gt;

standard commands executed every time the interpreter is started. You
can do this by setting an environment variable named PYTHONSTARTUP to
the name of a file containing your start-up commands. This is similar to
the .profile feature of the Unix shells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is only read in interactive sessions, not when Python reads
commands from a script, and not when /dev/tty is given as the explicit
source of commands (which otherwise behaves like an interactive
session). It is executed in the same namespace where interactive
commands are executed, so that objects that it defines or imports can be
used without qualification in the interactive session. You can also
change the prompts sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 in this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to read an additional start-up file from the current
directory, you can program this in the global start-up file using code
like if os.path.isfile('.pythonrc.py'): execfile('.pythonrc.py'). If you
want to use the startup file in a script, you must do this explicitly in
the script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;import os&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;filename = os.environ.get('PYTHONSTARTUP')&lt;/div&gt;
