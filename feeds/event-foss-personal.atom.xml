from the field of blogging , the guy who really was impressive was OM of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://giagaom.com"&gt;gigaom&lt;/a&gt; fame. He was too good after listening to
him and learning from his kind words i have decided to change the line
on my Blog from [STRIKEOUT:Change is certain what is your Foss
Startegy!!] to Change is Certain what about You!! sounds easy and makes
it more personal .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes my take on the event #WCI is , it met my expectations and i was more
than happy to meet new faces and understand there issues&amp;nbsp; with respect
to development,legal and start up point of view. Hope to be more active
and try to contribute to it in future!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now got to get back to setting my Page and playing with plethora
of plugins WP has to offer, i am a newbie to the blogging world do write
about the mistakes i am doing while writing or otherwise ....&lt;/p&gt;
