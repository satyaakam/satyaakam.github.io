&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~emurphy/stemnet/papert.html"&gt;Seymour Papert&lt;/a&gt;
and the people who have been influenced over decades by his writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last few years i have been &amp;nbsp;seeing a lots of buzz around the word
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course"&gt;MOOC&lt;/a&gt; ,
just few years before the &amp;nbsp;term like
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning"&gt;Elearning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;had a similar
effect on us &amp;nbsp;. Initially all the&amp;nbsp;entrepreneurial&amp;nbsp;kinds tried to
capitalize this rush using technologies in last two decade like Flash
etc and&amp;nbsp;everyone's&amp;nbsp;focus was on the content and selling this content in
the digital formats in India too there has been efforts , they were
basically digitizing all the textbooks and were calling it Elearning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then came the craze of devices like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child"&gt;OLPC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in 2006 , i
learned about it around 2007&amp;nbsp;, The idea was started will all good
intentions but it had its own flaws in the model and approach &amp;nbsp;, you can
learn about the current status of the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://one.laptop.org/"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;here . The two contributions i see
from this projects are&amp;nbsp;Netbooks , Tablets frenzy and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sugarlabs.org/"&gt;Sugar
Environment&lt;/a&gt; , which again are ideas which
are way ahead of time , when people are still stuck on there Elearning
mentality . all of a sudden the combo of hardware and software for a
digitized classroom became so important as though the world is going to
end tomorrow. Elearning companies popped up some of them made it through
this gold rush too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at this point i would like to differentiate between Education and
Learning , The so called form has changed from television to computers
and &amp;nbsp;now to internet . all that has been happening is so far in
&amp;nbsp;education is sort of push in the education terms .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter MOOC's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.khanacademy.org/"&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt; ,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; ,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.udacity.com/"&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/"&gt;Edx&lt;/a&gt;
,&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.p2pu.org"&gt;p2p&lt;/a&gt; ,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="%20http://www.udemy.com%20"&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are some good examples of these
here &amp;nbsp;again a wild rush to capitalize and transform the education sector
into an open play ground . Traditional universities have all joined in
&amp;nbsp;the race too .i feel because of over growing pressure to increase the
base and &amp;nbsp;reduce the capital expenditure they feel , this is it the holy
grail to fix education &amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two of MOOC's &amp;nbsp;happening here one is a unstructured and the
other is structured around to fit the traditional education &amp;nbsp;, the
content is good , exams and tests are all conducted on a scheduled way
in the structured form of delivery .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i did hacking around last year to make a clone of called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://satyaakam.net/2011/10/24/fork-from-fossacademy/"&gt;Fossacademy&lt;/a&gt;,
now i
see&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/"&gt;course-builder&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is
based out of it too , i have looked&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="p2pu.org"&gt;p2p&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;code base&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;,
the good thing them is they have a way to give students exercies and
measure there learning while they are enrolled to the courses , but the
approach i like the most so far has been the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism"&gt;Social
&amp;nbsp;contructivism&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;
and a good example of it find the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software"&gt;Free and Open source
culture&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;way
and project like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/%20"&gt;nand2tetris&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is happening to Education well its happening and places of
learning have started to pop up too in the name of New Age schools ,
since we need to re look at the way our next generations are going to
learn from things around them .&lt;/p&gt;
