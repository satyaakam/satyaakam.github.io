&lt;div class="line"&gt;off late things have become busy , not that you the reader are
idealing and reading this post of mine out or boredom or drudgery,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fossevents.in"&gt;Fossevents.in&lt;/a&gt; is coming up nicely , it has
been lying dormant for almost a year now it has seen some day of the
light thanks to the support from community .&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my vision of fossevents.in was only one and when we started , i was away
from organizing and running community activities for long and when i
came back i see the landscape has totally changed , there are events
happening all around you and you are not aware of the event which could
be happening right there in your neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my definition of an event is anything which is related to foss it can be
workshop, meeting , hackathons, training programs actually this was not
my idea of calling an foss event an event but slowly i realized that
these events are in no way less or more than others so they deserve a
mention on fossevents.in .&lt;/p&gt;
