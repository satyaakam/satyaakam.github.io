Benq&lt;/a&gt;
i bought myself a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.benq.co.in/products/joybook/?product=1503"&gt;gift for New
Year&lt;/a&gt; Joybook
Lite U 121 Eco from Nehru Place, New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually the itch has been going on for long after reading reviews on
various mailing lists in India, it was evident that finding a Netbook
with GNU/Linux installed would be a tough bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an eye on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.acer.co.in/acer/seu30e.do?LanguageISOCtxParam=hi&amp;amp;link=ln374e&amp;amp;CountryISOCtxParam=IN&amp;amp;acond125e=57989&amp;amp;kcond48e.c2att101=57989&amp;amp;sp=page17e&amp;amp;ctx1g.c2att92=867&amp;amp;ctx2.c2att1=158&amp;amp;ctx1.att21k=1&amp;amp;CRC=1620424451"&gt;Acer One
D250&lt;/a&gt;
for long. But it was a no no after reading this presentation by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tree.celinuxforum.org/CelfPubWiki/ELCEurope2009Presentations?action=AttachFile&amp;amp;do=get‚åñ=Mythbusters_Android.pdf"&gt;Matt
Porter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i strongly recommend for all the mobile developers to consider reading
this before diving into the Android way of undoing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok coming back to the story of why Benq all in the world , since Acer
was already ruled out and Asus had some good recommendations , Benq was
definitely was not on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had a look at the two Joy Book models one was with smaller screen and
lesser hard disk space , the other was recommended by the marketing guy
as it came with Linpus .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linpus still does not connect me to the Net , i called up there office
had to go round in circles aka musical chairs, but still i wanted to
taste first hand reasons why folks don't make GNU/Linux based Netbooks
or Laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer i suppose is a well know one in FOSS world &amp;quot;Support&amp;quot; , i am
still exploring and finding how the OEM is tied to Linpus and what
support aggrement i am entitled to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the meantime i did not want to install any other OS and get online
ASAP since i am still exploring and expecting some form of decent
support from the Vendor ;-( , more on that later...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime i had a liveusb with Ubuntu 9.10 to test the wifi, it
too does not work out of the box , i got it working working by inserting
rt kernel module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;$sudo su -&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;#modprobe rt3070sta&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enabled the network by pressing function key and F10&lt;/p&gt;
