around 150 Kms from Chennai here is a route map&lt;a class="reference external" href="%20http://bit.ly/apHOGm"&gt;Route
Map&lt;/a&gt; , and pictures below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="100%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.co.in/satyaakam/OLPCInChennai?authkey=Gv1sRgCNOGjMbSnseI7wE&amp;amp;feat=embedwebsite"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_921THjGHtbk/S89Annxf0mE/AAAAAAAAAyk/Ej6pseByBv0/s160-c/OLPCInChennai.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.co.in/satyaakam/OLPCInChennai?authkey=Gv1sRgCNOGjMbSnseI7wE&amp;amp;feat=embedwebsite"&gt;OLPC in Chennai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, overall the visit has been fruitful saw sugar &amp;#64; work kids discovering
and learning new things on there own , there were some 10 Xo's which
attracted around 200 kids from in and around the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was too hot and dry i did not feel the humidity like Chennai
so suggested them to install water cooler . The most popular activities
were Paint , Wikipedia , lack to Internet is something which needs to be
looked into to get these kids talk out to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on 20th the next day i visited one more school which is a govt school
which is under&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ssa.tn.nic.in/"&gt;Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan&lt;/a&gt;
programme of govt of India , here i learned about the ABL ( activity
based learning ) which is similar to activity based in Sugar but it was
more structured in the sense of the kid goes from one class to other
after he has completed a set of activities in on subject or class. In
this school the four XO's are provided the programme is schedule to
begin after summer holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;things to be done in coming days , XO's need Sugar upgrade. Teachers
need training , identify kids who can teach other kids , get Internet
connection so that they can connect to the larger OLPC community .&lt;/p&gt;
