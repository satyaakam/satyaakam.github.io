page&lt;/a&gt;, had no clue
who the organizers were and the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.schoolofconvergence.com/"&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; we were going to . The
page just mentioned about telling stories with data. Staying with the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://datameet.org/"&gt;open data&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;community i had a clue of what was
coming , but did not have a clear agenda or plan of action for next few
hours we were going to stay at the meetup.One of the datasets i have
been hearing about a lot past few months &amp;nbsp;is from the data.gov.in
website , since my rendevous with the Open Data from govt has been
limited to the public data available through
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chalobest.in"&gt;chalobest.in&lt;/a&gt; project , this project still
has not been realized in &amp;nbsp;NCR area. Anyway the place was a buzz with
people of all age groups mostly students from journalism and activists
too . we all sat in small groups either talking about an idea or data
set we would be working on . Since i was interested in the data sets
from Govt , we picked the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://data.gov.in/dataset/infant-mortality-rate-imr"&gt;infant mortality
rate&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;it was
in CSV format , the big picture was to create a Heatmap out of &amp;nbsp;the
data&amp;nbsp;available&amp;nbsp;, the first thing we noticed was there were not lat longs
for the states , so two members from team &amp;#64;arcolife &amp;nbsp;and Myself sat down
with the site&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.geonames.org/"&gt;Geonames.org&lt;/a&gt;to collect
&amp;nbsp;the same , in the meantime &amp;#64;bhanuvrat , &amp;#64;kanteshraj were writing
scripts to the data transformed &amp;nbsp;in the format required . Ramniq was our
anchor man who was putting everything together , he started of with the
Heatmap code , initially he was dablling with Openlayers later we
switched to Leaflet which was much easier to code in . Overall at the
end of it we produced the following heat map .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="heatmap" class="align-center" src="../images/heatmap.png" style="width: 600px; height: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which was sort of hardcoded and &amp;nbsp;static one with the limitations of time
we could produce here is the code for the
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/ramniquesingh/heatmap-demo/src"&gt;Heatmap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience has been good for everyone since we we were getting
together after longtime and produced something in the end. Scope for
improvements we can cover more years with &amp;nbsp;a time line kind of interface
and really see it visually which is kind of nice than just some dry
numbers on a spread sheet . We dispersed with lots of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.476488175739797&amp;amp;type=1"&gt;sweet
memories&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
hope to have more such events in future.&lt;/p&gt;
