    <p>You twit N times a day , when you meet people you ask Are you on
FaceBook , Linked in , or any of the social networking sites , do you
make friends then meet or friend is just a number game for you , are
these social networking sites really helping the Family and society as a
unit together or its just an extension to say hi to everyone and giving
updates on status of your social well being ? is FB just an extension to
good old community living or just a way to survive in a &nbsp;world where
connecting and meeting folks on FB is just an easy way that &nbsp;you have
accepted and want to continue. What is your &nbsp;the definition of being
socially active ?</p>
<p>What happened to the good old Sarai's and community programs do they
still exist or taken a new avatar and use FaceBook as only a platform ,
what happened to our good old Linux Users Groups
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.linux-india.org/">http://www.linux-india.org/</a> LUG's are they thriving because of a New
tool in the form of social networking sites or they just don't exist
anymore , or they have lost somewhere in middle in all the noise try to
to find a meaning of Community .</p>
<p>I think the FOSS as a technology has matured enough and has been
embraced &nbsp;by industry, and the level of bifurcation or so called
specialization has reached &nbsp;a stage &nbsp;where in we need specific users
groups like firefox , open office , Coders,Admins , Activist so on and
so forth , i see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gtugs.org/">http://www.gtugs.org/</a> too &nbsp;poping up and discussusions
floating around on &nbsp;LUG mailing lists &nbsp;about have jquery or
Drupal/Wordpress sessions actually Jermy allision and chris di bona
talks about this phenomenon in this
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBIFY6OGMBg">video</a> &nbsp;too. I see this
phenomenon happening in India also &nbsp;.</p>
<p>So the meaning of being social or community is getting into &nbsp;smaller
groups with focus on few things and more towards mechanization of
something like assembly like with folks doing smaller tasks in big
numbers and other things like Internet , distributions , email , irc ,
FaceBook will be taken granted for that they will not be meeting too
often physically untill and unless some project demands.</p>
